# 1. MCP Overview

**Purpose:** Explain what the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is, why it exists, and how it enables secure AI agent interactions with external tools and services.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized interface that enables AI agents to safely interact with external tools, databases, and services. Released by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP has gained massive adoption and is quickly becoming the connective tissue between AI agents and the tools they act on.

### Core Concept

MCP provides a **standardized communication layer** between AI clients (like Claude Desktop) and external servers (like mcp-ssh-orchestrator). Think of it as an "API schema for AI tools" that ensures:

- **Consistent interfaces** across different tools
- **Type-safe communication** with structured data
- **Security boundaries** between agents and external systems
- **Audit trails** for all interactions

## Why MCP Exists

### The Problem: Uncontrolled AI Tool Access

Before MCP, AI agents typically accessed external systems through:

- **Custom APIs** with inconsistent interfaces
- **Direct shell access** with unlimited privileges  
- **Hardcoded integrations** that were difficult to audit
- **No standardization** across different tools

This led to:
- **Security vulnerabilities** (43% of analyzed servers have command injection flaws)
- **Inconsistent behavior** across different tools
- **Difficult auditing** and compliance
- **Vendor lock-in** with proprietary interfaces

### The Solution: Standardized, Secure Protocol

MCP addresses these issues by providing:

1. **Standardized Interface**: All MCP servers implement the same protocol
2. **Type Safety**: Structured request/response formats
3. **Security Boundaries**: Clear separation between clients and servers
4. **Auditability**: Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities
5. **Composability**: Mix and match different MCP servers

## MCP Transport Types

MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:

### stdio Transport (Most Common)
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "ssh_run",
    "arguments": {
      "alias": "web1",
      "command": "uptime"
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Local development
- Docker containers
- Process-to-process communication

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
```javascript
// Client connects to SSE endpoint
const eventSource = new EventSource('/mcp/sse');

// Server streams responses
eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {
  const response = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // Handle MCP response
};
```

**Use Cases:**
- Web applications
- Real-time streaming
- Cross-origin communication

### HTTP/WebSocket
```bash
# HTTP POST request
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call",...}'
```

**Use Cases:**
- REST APIs
- WebSocket connections
- Cloud deployments

## MCP vs Traditional Approaches

| Aspect | Traditional APIs | MCP |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| **Interface** | Custom, inconsistent | Standardized protocol |
| **Security** | Ad-hoc, varies by tool | Built-in security boundaries |
| **Auditing** | Manual, inconsistent | Structured logging |
| **Composability** | Difficult to combine | Designed for composition |
| **Type Safety** | Often string-based | Structured JSON-RPC |
| **Transport** | Usually HTTP only | Multiple transport options |

## MCP Security Model

MCP introduces a **layered security model** that addresses the unique challenges of AI agent interactions:

### 1. Transport Security
- **Encrypted communication** (TLS for HTTP/WebSocket)
- **Process isolation** (stdio transport)
- **Authentication** at the transport layer

### 2. Protocol Security
- **Structured requests** prevent injection attacks
- **Type validation** ensures data integrity
- **Error handling** prevents information leakage

### 3. Server Security
- **Containerized execution** with resource limits
- **Policy enforcement** at the server level
- **Audit logging** for all operations

### 4. Client Security
- **Tool allowlists** restrict available servers
- **Signature verification** ensures server authenticity
- **Call interceptors** for pre/post processing
