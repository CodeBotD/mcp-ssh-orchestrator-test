## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

**Imagine this:** Your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) can access your servers, but you're terrified of what it might do. `rm -rf /`? Delete your databases? Change firewall rules?

**Now imagine this:** Your AI has governed, auditable access to your infrastructure. It can check logs, restart services, and manage your fleet—**but only if your security policies allow it.**

That's exactly what MCP SSH Orchestrator provides: **the power of AI-driven server management with military-grade security controls**.

## ✨ Why This Matters

### 🔒 **Zero-Trust Security Model**
- **Deny-by-default**: Nothing runs unless explicitly allowed
- **Network controls**: IP allowlists prevent lateral movement
- **Command whitelisting**: Only approved commands can execute
- **Comprehensive audit trails**: Every action is logged in JSON

### 🚫 **Prevents Common Attack Vectors**
- ❌ **Dangerous commands blocked**: `rm -rf`, `dd`, file deletions
- ❌ **Network isolation**: Servers can't access external internet
- ❌ **No privilege escalation**: Runs as non-root in containers
- ❌ **Resource limits**: CPU and memory caps prevent DOS

### 📊 **Production-Ready Audit & Compliance**
- **Structured JSON audit logs**: Complete audit trail with timestamps, hashes, and IPs
- **Compliance-supporting logs**: Can support SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA reporting (certification is organization's responsibility)
- **Forensics ready**: Command hashing, IP tracking, detailed metadata
- **Real-time monitoring**: Progress logs for long-running tasks

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

### **Homelab Enthusiasts** 🏠
- Automate routine server maintenance with AI
- Safely manage Proxmox, TrueNAS, Docker hosts
- Get help troubleshooting without losing SSH security

### **Security Engineers** 🛡️
- Audit and control AI access to infrastructure
- Implement zero-trust principles with policy-as-code
- Meet compliance requirements with structured logging

### **DevOps Teams** ⚙️
- Let AI handle routine tasks: log checks, service restarts, updates
- Manage fleets of servers through conversational interface
- Reduce manual toil while maintaining security standards

### **Platform Engineers** 🔧
- Enable AI-powered infrastructure management
- Provide secure self-service access to developers
- Bridge the gap between AI and infrastructure securely

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Homelab Automation 🏠
**You say:** *"Claude, my home server is running slow. Can you check the disk usage on my Proxmox host?"*

**What happens:**
- ✅ Policy checks: Only `df -h` allowed on that host
- ✅ Network check: Proxmox IP is in allowlist
- ✅ Command executes safely
- ✅ Audit log records the operation

### Scenario 2: Incident Response 🚨
**You say:** *"Check nginx logs for errors across all web servers"*

**What happens:**
- ✅ Tag-based execution runs `tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log` on all web servers
- ✅ Network-isolated execution (no external access)
- ✅ Real-time progress logs show you what's happening
- ✅ Complete audit trail for post-incident review

### Scenario 3: Compliance & Auditing 📊
**Your security team needs to know:** *"Who accessed what and when?"*

**What happens:**
- ✅ JSON audit logs capture every action with timestamps
- ✅ Command hashing preserves privacy while enabling forensics
- ✅ IP addresses logged for network compliance
- ✅ Easy to parse with `jq` for reporting

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/samerfarida/mcp-ssh-orchestrator:latest

# Run interactively
docker run -i --rm \
  -v ~/mcp-ssh/config:/app/config:ro \
  -v ~/mcp-ssh/keys:/app/keys:ro \
  ghcr.io/samerfarida/mcp-ssh-orchestrator:latest
```

## 🔒 How Security Works (The Technical Details)

### 🛡️ Defense-in-Depth Architecture

```
Layer 1: Transport Security    → stdio, container isolation
Layer 2: Network Security      → IP allowlists, host key verification  
Layer 3: Policy Security        → Deny-by-default, pattern matching
Layer 4: Application Security  → Non-root execution, resource limits
```

### 🚫 What Gets Blocked

```yaml
# Dangerous commands automatically denied
deny_substrings:
  - "rm -rf"
  - "dd if="
  - "mkfs"
  - "fdisk"
  - "> /dev"

# Network isolation enforced
network:
  allow: ["10.0.0.0/8"]  # Only private IPs
  deny: ["0.0.0.0/0"]     # No public internet access
```

### ✅ What Gets Allowed (Examples)

```yaml
# Safe, read-only commands
rules:
  - patterns: ["uptime", "df -h", "free -m"]
    action: allow
    
# Log inspection (safe)
  - patterns: ["tail -f", "grep", "journalctl"]
    action: allow
    
# Service management (controlled)
  - patterns: ["systemctl restart"]
    action: allow
    tags: ["web", "db"]  # Only on specific servers
```
