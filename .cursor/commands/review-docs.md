# Review and Update Documentation

Help me comprehensively review and update the repository documentation to ensure it accurately represents the MCP SSH Orchestrator codebase, with code as the source of truth.

## Overview

This command performs a thorough review of:
- All source code in `src/mcp_ssh/` (tools, features, configurations, security)
- All CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/` (build, release, security, signing)
- All test suites in `tests/` (unit tests, MCP compliance, validation)
- All documentation files (README.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, docs/, examples/, etc.)
- Alignment between code, workflows, tests, and documentation
- Markdown linting and formatting issues
- Code block correctness
- Example configurations and their accuracy
- Mermaid diagrams (if any)
- MCP specification compliance documentation

## Steps to follow

### Phase 0: Prepare Working Branch

1. **Check current git status:**
   - Get the current branch name
   - Check for uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged)
   - Check for untracked files

2. **Handle uncommitted changes (if any):**
   - If there are uncommitted changes, present options to the user:
     - **Option 1: Stash** (recommended) - Save changes for later with a descriptive message
     - **Option 2: Commit** - Guide user to commit changes first
     - **Option 3: Discard** - Warn about data loss and confirm before proceeding
     - **Option 4: Cancel** - Abort the operation
   - Wait for user's choice before proceeding

3. **Switch to main branch:**
   - Fetch latest changes from remote: `git fetch origin`
   - Switch to main: `git checkout main` (or `git switch main`)
   - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
   - Verify we're on main and up to date

4. **Create new branch for documentation review:**
   - Create a new branch with descriptive name: `git checkout -b docs/review-and-update-docs` (or similar)
   - Verify we're on the new branch
   - Confirm we're ready to start the review

5. **Confirm readiness:**
   - Show current git status
   - Show current branch name
   - Confirm we're ready to proceed with documentation review

    - Confirm all changes are non-breaking improvements

## Important notes

- **Start from latest main**: Always work from the latest main branch to ensure we're reviewing against current codebase
- **Work in feature branch**: Create a dedicated branch for documentation review changes
- **Code, workflows, and tests are sources of truth**: If documentation says something but it doesn't exist in code/workflows/tests, update the documentation
- **Stay factual**: Only document what exists in the code/workflows/tests, no roadmap items
- **Document CI/CD accurately**: Ensure GPG signing, image signing, and security processes match actual workflows
- **Document testing accurately**: Ensure unit tests, MCP inspector, and validation practices match actual test files
- **MCP compliance**: Ensure MCP specification compliance is clearly stated in documentation
- **Non-breaking changes only**: Make improvements but don't restructure major sections
- **Preserve intent**: Keep the spirit and structure of existing documentation
- **Verify everything**: Don't assume - check code/workflows/tests for every documented feature
- **Test examples**: Ensure all code examples are syntactically correct and match actual usage
- **Be thorough**: Review every file, every tool, every feature, every workflow, every test
- **Document the process**: Show what was reviewed and what was changed

## Output format

For each file reviewed, provide:
- Status: ✅ Accurate / ⚠️ Needs Updates / ❌ Major Issues
- Issues found (if any)
- Changes made (if any)
- Recommendations (if any)
